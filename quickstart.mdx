This guide will walk you through creating your first modpack and exporting a server configuration file for Project Zomboid.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:

- A Discord account (for authentication)
- A Project Zomboid dedicated server (or planning to set one up)
- Access to Steam Workshop for Project Zomboid mods

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your account">
    Navigate to PZ Packs and sign in with Discord.

    1. Click **Sign in with Discord** on the homepage
    2. Authorize PZ Packs to access your Discord profile
    3. You'll be redirected back to PZ Packs, now authenticated

    <Note>
      PZ Packs uses Discord OAuth for authentication. Your Discord email and profile information are used to create your account.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your first modpack">
    Once authenticated, create a modpack to organize your server mods.

    1. Click **Create Modpack** from your dashboard
    2. Fill in the modpack details:
       - **Name**: Give your modpack a descriptive name
       - **Description**: Explain what your modpack is for
       - **Avatar URL** (optional): Add an image for your modpack
       - **Steam URL** (optional): Link to a related Steam collection
    3. Set visibility:
       - **Public**: Anyone can view and use your modpack
       - **Private**: Only you and invited members can access it
    4. Click **Create**

    Your modpack is now created and you'll be taken to its detail page.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add mods to your modpack">
    Add Project Zomboid mods to your modpack. You have three options:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Import from Steam">
        The fastest way to add multiple mods at once.

        1. Find or create a Steam Workshop Collection with your desired mods
        2. Copy the collection URL (e.g., `https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=123456789`)
        3. In your modpack, click **Import from Steam**
        4. Paste the collection URL
        5. Click **Import**

        The import runs in the background. You can check the status on your modpack page.

        <Tip>
          Steam collections are a great way to organize and share mod lists. Create one on Steam Workshop first, then import it into PZ Packs.
        </Tip>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Search and add">
        Browse the PZ Packs mod catalog to find specific mods.

        1. Go to the **Mods** tab
        2. Search by name, tag, or Workshop ID
        3. Click on a mod to view details
        4. Click **Add to Modpack** and select your modpack

        The mod will be added to your modpack immediately.
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Add by Workshop ID">
        If you know the Steam Workshop ID of a mod:

        1. In your modpack, click **Add Mod**
        2. Enter the Workshop ID (e.g., `2169435993`)
        3. Click **Add**

        The mod details will be fetched from Steam Workshop and added to your modpack.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Warning>
      Some mods have dependencies (required mods). PZ Packs will show these in the mod details, but you need to manually add them to your modpack.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure mod order">
    Mod load order can be important for compatibility.

    1. On your modpack page, view the list of mods
    2. Drag and drop mods to reorder them
    3. Place core/framework mods first, content mods later
    4. Save the order

    <Info>
      The mod order determines the load order in Project Zomboid. Some mods require specific ordering to work correctly.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure export settings">
    Before exporting, configure your server version and mod settings.

    1. Click **Export Configuration** on your modpack page
    2. Select your Project Zomboid version:
       - **Build 41.x**: Uses `ModID=Workshop_ID` format
       - **Build 42.x**: Uses `WorkshopID` format
    3. For mods with multiple Steam Mod IDs, select which ones to include
    4. Click **Save Configuration**

    <Note>
      Some mods have multiple Steam Mod IDs for different components (e.g., separate map and mod IDs). You can choose which ones to include in your export.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export server configuration">
    Generate your server configuration file.

    1. Click **Request Server File**
    2. Choose your version (41.x or 42.x)
    3. Click **Generate**

    The file generation runs in the background (usually takes 5-10 seconds).

    4. Once complete, click **Download** to get your configuration file

    The downloaded file will be named something like `modpack_name_41x.txt` or `modpack_name_42x.txt`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install on your server">
    Use the exported configuration file on your Project Zomboid dedicated server.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Windows Server">
        1. Navigate to your server directory (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUser\Zomboid\Server\`)
        2. Open the server config file (e.g., `servertest.ini`)
        3. Find the `Mods=` and `WorkshopItems=` lines
        4. Replace them with the content from your downloaded file
        5. If there's a `Map=` line in the export, update that too
        6. Save the file
        7. Restart your server
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="Linux Server">
        1. Navigate to your server directory (e.g., `/home/user/Zomboid/Server/`)
        2. Open the server config file (e.g., `servertest.ini`)
        3. Find the `Mods=` and `WorkshopItems=` lines
        4. Replace them with the content from your downloaded file
        5. If there's a `Map=` line in the export, update that too
        6. Save the file
        7. Restart your server
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Warning>
      Always backup your server configuration before making changes. If something goes wrong, you can restore the backup.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Mods not loading on server">
    If your mods aren't loading after updating the server config:

    - Verify the server has internet access to download from Steam Workshop
    - Check the server logs for mod loading errors
    - Ensure the Workshop IDs are correct in your config
    - Make sure you restarted the server after updating the config
    - For Build 42.x servers, use the 42.x export format (not 41.x)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Import from Steam failing">
    If Steam Collection import fails:

    - Verify the collection URL is correct and public
    - Check if the collection contains Project Zomboid mods (not other games)
    - Wait a few moments and check the import status again
    - Some collections with many mods (50+) may take longer to import
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't find a specific mod">
    If you can't find a mod in the PZ Packs catalog:

    - Try adding it by Workshop ID directly
    - The mod may be too new - PZ Packs updates its catalog regularly
    - Verify the mod exists on Steam Workshop and is for Project Zomboid
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
