title: Managing Team Permissions
description: Add team members and control permissions for collaborative modpack management
---

Collaborate on modpacks with your team by adding members and configuring their permissions. This guide covers the permission system, adding and removing members, and best practices for team modpacks.

## Understanding the Permission Model

PZ Packs uses a flexible permission system for modpack collaboration:

### Ownership vs Membership

- **Owner** - The user who created the modpack
  - Full control over all modpack settings
  - Can add and remove members
  - Can archive/delete the modpack
  - Cannot be removed or changed

- **Members** - Users invited to collaborate
  - Permissions granted by owner
  - Can be added or removed by owner
  - Access levels determined by permission array

### Permission Array Structure

Permissions are stored as an array of strings, allowing flexible and granular access control:

```json
{
  "permission": ["read", "write", "export"]
}
```

Each member has their own set of permissions configured by the modpack owner.

<Note>
The current implementation requires at least one permission when adding a member. Empty permission arrays are not allowed.
</Note>

## Permission Types

While the system is flexible, common permission patterns include:

### Read Access
- View modpack details
- See mod list
- View other members (if modpack is private)

Typical permission: `["read"]`

### Write Access
- Add and remove mods
- Import from Steam Workshop
- Modify modpack metadata
- Includes read access implicitly

Typical permission: `["read", "write"]`

### Export Access
- Generate server configuration files
- Configure personal export settings
- Download export files

Typical permission: `["read", "export"]`

### Full Collaboration
- All read, write, and export permissions
- Cannot add/remove members (owner only)
- Cannot archive modpack (owner only)

Typical permission: `["read", "write", "export"]`

<Warning>
Only the modpack owner can add or remove members. Members cannot invite other users, even with write permissions.
</Warning>

## Adding Team Members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify you're the owner">
    Only the modpack owner can add members. If you try to add a member to a modpack you don't own, you'll receive:
    
    <Warning>
    "Only the owner can add members to this modpack"
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the add member dialog">
    On your modpack page, click "Add Member" or the team management button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the user's email">
    Type the email address of the user you want to invite:
    
    ```
    user@example.com
    ```
    
    The email must:
    - Be a valid email format
    - Belong to an existing PZ Packs user
    - Not already be a member of this modpack
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select permissions">
    Choose which permissions to grant:
    
    - For viewers: `["read"]`
    - For contributors: `["read", "write"]`
    - For server managers: `["read", "export"]`
    - For full collaborators: `["read", "write", "export"]`
    
    At least one permission is required.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add the member">
    Click "Add Member" to send the invitation.
    
    The user is immediately added and can access the modpack based on their permissions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Adding Members - Common Scenarios

**User not found:**
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "User not found with this email"
  }
}
```
The email doesn't match any PZ Packs account. Ask the user to sign up first.

**Already a member:**
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "User is already a member of this modpack"
  }
}
```
This user is already on the team. Update their permissions instead of adding them again.

**Invalid email:**
```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "Invalid email format"
  }
}
```
Check the email address for typos.

## Viewing Team Members

All team members and their roles are visible:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access the members list">
    On the modpack page, view the "Team" or "Members" section.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review member information">
    For each member, you can see:
    - User name and avatar
    - Email address
    - Assigned permissions
    - Join date
    - Active status
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify the owner">
    The modpack owner is displayed separately or with an "Owner" badge.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Public vs Private Modpacks

- **Public modpacks** - Members list is visible to everyone
- **Private modpacks** - Members list only visible to owner and members

## Removing Team Members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify you're the owner">
    Only the modpack owner can remove members.
    
    <Warning>
    "Only the owner can remove members from this modpack"
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select the member to remove">
    On the members list, find the user you want to remove and click the remove button or icon.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm removal">
    A confirmation dialog appears:
    
    "Are you sure you want to remove **[User Name]** from this modpack?"
    
    This action:
    - Immediately revokes their access
    - Removes them from the members list
    - Cannot be undone (you must re-invite them)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete the removal">
    Click "Remove" to confirm.
    
    Success message:
    ```json
    {
      "message": "Member removed successfully"
    }
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Removing a member doesn't delete their personal export configurations. If you re-add them later, their previous export settings may still exist.
</Note>

## Permission Checks in Action

Here's how permissions are validated for common operations:

### Importing Mods from Steam

When a user tries to import:

1. **Check if modpack exists** - Returns 404 if not found
2. **Check if modpack is active** - Archived modpacks cannot be modified
3. **Check ownership** - Is the user the owner?
4. **Check membership** - If not owner, is the user an active member?
5. **Deny if neither** - "You do not have permission to edit this modpack"

From the controller at `apps/api/src/domain/modpack/controllers/import-modpack.controller.ts:39-59`:

```typescript
const isOwner = modpack.owner === user.id
let isMember = false

if (!isOwner) {
  const member = await this.modpackMemberRepository.findMember(
    modpackId,
    user.id,
  )
  if (member?.isActive) {
    isMember = true
  }
}

if (!isOwner && !isMember) {
  return new ApiResponse(
    {
      error: { message: 'You do not have permission to edit this modpack' },
    },
    403,
  )
}
```

### Adding/Removing Members

Only the owner can modify team membership:

```typescript
if (modpack.owner !== user.id) {
  return new ApiResponse(
    {
      error: {
        message: 'Only the owner can add members to this modpack',
      },
    },
    403,
  )
}
```

From `apps/api/src/domain/modpack/controler/add-member.ts:35-44`

### Viewing Modpack Details

Public modpacks are visible to everyone. Private modpacks require ownership or membership.

<Tip>
Permissions are checked on the backend for security. Frontend UI may hide buttons for actions users can't perform, but the API always validates permissions.
</Tip>

## Best Practices for Team Modpacks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define clear roles">
    Decide who needs which permissions:
    
    - **Viewers** - `["read"]` - Teammates who just need to see the mod list
    - **Curators** - `["read", "write"]` - Members who add/remove mods
    - **Server Admins** - `["read", "export"]` - Those who deploy to servers
    - **Co-Owners** - `["read", "write", "export"]` - Full collaborators
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use descriptive modpack names">
    For team projects, include the team or server name:
    
    - "[Clan] Official Server Modpack"
    - "Community Build 42 Collection"
    - "[Team Name] Event Mods"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Communicate changes">
    When adding or removing mods:
    
    - Notify team members of major changes
    - Document why mods were added/removed
    - Coordinate before importing large collections
  </Step>

  <Step title="Regular audits">
    Periodically review:
    
    - Who has access to the modpack
    - Whether permissions are still appropriate
    - Remove inactive members
  </Step>

  <Step title="Separate configs for different servers">
    If running multiple servers:
    
    - Create separate modpacks for each server
    - Or use personal export configurations for different deployments
    - Don't try to manage multiple server configs in one modpack
  </Step>

  <Step title="Backup before major changes">
    Before large imports or restructuring:
    
    - Export your current server file as backup
    - Document the current mod list
    - Test changes on a development server first
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced: Permission Extensibility

The permission system uses an array structure for future extensibility:

```typescript
permission: text('permission').array().notNull()
```

This design allows for:

- Custom permission strings
- Fine-grained access control
- Future features without schema changes
- Role-based templates

<Note>
While the system supports custom permissions, the current API validates permissions based on ownership and membership status. Additional permission types may be added in future updates.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Add Member

**Problem:** Add member button is disabled or missing

**Solution:**
- Verify you're the modpack owner
- Check that the modpack is active (not archived)
- Ensure you're logged in

### Member Can't Import Mods

**Problem:** Member receives permission error when importing

**Solution:**
- Verify the member is listed in the members table
- Check that their `isActive` status is `true`
- Confirm the modpack itself is active
- Re-add the member if their membership is inactive

### Permission Errors After Adding Member

**Problem:** Newly added member still gets permission errors

**Solution:**
- Have the member log out and back in
- Check that the member was added successfully (view members list)
- Verify the permission array is not empty
- Try removing and re-adding the member

### Can't Remove Member

**Problem:** Remove button doesn't work or shows error

**Solution:**
- You can only remove members, not the owner
- Verify you're the modpack owner
- Check if the member is already removed (refresh the page)
- Ensure the member exists in the database
