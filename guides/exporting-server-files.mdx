title: Exporting Server Configuration Files
description: Generate and download server configuration files for your Project Zomboid dedicated server
---

Export your modpack as a server configuration file that's ready to use with Project Zomboid dedicated servers. This guide covers version selection, export configuration, downloading files, and installation on your server.

## Overview

PZ Packs generates server configuration files containing three critical sections:
- **Mods** - Mod IDs in the correct format for your PZ version
- **WorkshopItems** - Steam Workshop IDs for automatic downloading
- **Map** - Custom map folders plus default maps

These files can be directly added to your dedicated server configuration to load all mods from your modpack.

<Note>
Export files are generated in the background and are user-specific. Your export configuration (mod order, variant selection) is saved separately from other team members.
</Note>

## Choosing a Project Zomboid Version

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select your server version">
    PZ Packs supports two Project Zomboid versions:
    
    - **Build 42.x** - Latest unstable/beta branch (recommended for new servers)
    - **Build 41.x** - Stable branch (for established servers)
    
    The version you select determines the mod ID format in the generated file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand format differences">
    **Build 42.x format:**
    ```ini
    Mods=\ModID1;\ModID2;\ModID3
    ```
    
    **Build 41.x format:**
    ```ini
    Mods=ModID1;ModID2;ModID3
    ```
    
    The only difference is the backslash prefix (`\`) required in Build 42.x.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Match your server version">
    <Warning>
    Choose the version that matches your dedicated server. Using the wrong format will prevent mods from loading correctly.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Configuring Export Settings

Before exporting, you can customize how mods are included in your server file.

### Mod Load Order

Mod order can affect gameplay and compatibility:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set your preferred load order">
    Configure `modsOrder` to specify the exact sequence mods should load. This is saved in your personal export configuration.
    
    ```json
    {
      "modsOrder": ["mod-id-1", "mod-id-2", "mod-id-3"]
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Order importance">
    - Load order matters for mods that override similar game files
    - Map mods typically load first
    - Dependency mods should load before mods that require them
    - PZ Packs respects your configured order in the generated file
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Selecting Mod Variants

Some Workshop items contain multiple mod IDs (variants or optional components):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review mods with multiple variants">
    Mods with multiple Steam Mod IDs appear with checkboxes or selection options in the export configuration.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure variant selection">
    Use the `modConfig` setting to choose which variants to include:
    
    ```json
    {
      "modConfig": {
        "mod-id-123": {
          "selectedSteamModIds": ["variant1", "variant2"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    Only the selected variants will appear in the exported file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Exclude mods entirely">
    To skip a mod completely, deselect all its variants:
    
    ```json
    {
      "modConfig": {
        "mod-id-456": {
          "selectedSteamModIds": []
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
    This mod won't appear in `Mods=`, `WorkshopItems=`, or `Map=` sections.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Saving Export Configuration

Your export configuration is saved per user and per modpack:

- Configuration persists between exports
- Changes only affect your exports, not other team members
- Modpack owner can set default configuration for all members

<Tip>
Save your export configuration after adjusting mod order or variants. This ensures consistent exports every time without reconfiguring.
</Tip>

## Requesting a Server File Export

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the export dialog">
    On your modpack page, click the "Export" or "Download Server File" button.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Project Zomboid version">
    Choose between Build 42.x or Build 41.x from the version dropdown.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit export request">
    Click "Export" to queue the file generation.
    
    The system will:
    - Create an export request in the database
    - Add a background job to generate the file
    - Return an export ID for tracking
  </Step>

  <Step title="Wait for generation">
    File generation typically takes a few seconds. Large modpacks (100+ mods) may take longer.
    
    Status updates:
    - **Pending** - Export is queued or generating
    - **Completed** - File is ready for download
    - **Failed** - An error occurred during generation
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Generated File

The exported file contains three sections:

### Mods Section

Lists all mod IDs in the format appropriate for your selected version:

```ini
Mods=\ModID1;\ModID2;\ModID3
```

- Includes selected variants only
- Duplicates are automatically removed
- Order matches your `modsOrder` configuration

### WorkshopItems Section

Lists Steam Workshop IDs for automatic mod downloading:

```ini
WorkshopItems=123456789;987654321;555555555
```

- Contains Workshop IDs from all included mods
- Used by the server to auto-download mods from Steam
- Duplicates are automatically removed

### Map Section

Includes custom map folders plus the default Muldraugh map:

```ini
Map=CustomMap1;CustomMap2;Muldraugh, KY
```

- Automatically includes `Muldraugh, KY` as the default spawn
- Custom map folders are extracted from mod metadata
- Only includes maps from active, selected mods

<Note>
The default map "Muldraugh, KY" is always included. Remove it manually if you want a custom map-only server.
</Note>

## Downloading the Server File

<Steps>
  <Step title="Wait for completion">
    When the export status shows "Completed", the download button becomes available.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Download the file">
    Click the download button to retrieve your server configuration file.
    
    The file is a plain text `.ini` file containing the three configuration sections.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify file contents">
    Open the file in a text editor and verify:
    - All expected mods are listed
    - The mod ID format matches your server version (backslashes for 42.x)
    - Workshop IDs are present
    - Map sections look correct
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Installing on Your Project Zomboid Server

<Steps>
  <Step title="Locate your server configuration file">
    On your dedicated server, find the server configuration file:
    
    **Windows:**
    ```
    C:\Users\YourUser\Zomboid\Server\ServerName.ini
    ```
    
    **Linux:**
    ```
    ~/.config/ProjectZomboid/Server/ServerName.ini
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Backup existing configuration">
    Before making changes, create a backup:
    
    ```bash
    cp ServerName.ini ServerName.ini.backup
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update configuration sections">
    Open your server's `.ini` file and find these lines:
    
    ```ini
    Mods=
    Map=
    WorkshopItems=
    ```
    
    Replace them with the values from your exported file.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Restart the server">
    Restart your Project Zomboid dedicated server to load the new mods.
    
    On first launch:
    - Server downloads all Workshop items from Steam
    - This can take several minutes for large mod lists
    - Monitor server logs for download progress
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify mods loaded">
    Check your server logs for:
    
    ```
    Loaded mod: ModID1
    Loaded mod: ModID2
    ...
    ```
    
    All mods from your export should appear as loaded.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
If any mods fail to load, check:
- Workshop items downloaded successfully
- Mod IDs match the format for your server version
- No conflicting mods in the list
- Server version matches the export version (41.x or 42.x)
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Mods Not Loading

**Issue:** Server starts but mods don't load

**Solutions:**
- Verify the `Mods=` format matches your server version
- Build 42.x requires backslash prefix: `\ModID`
- Build 41.x has no prefix: `ModID`
- Check that Workshop items downloaded (look in server logs)

### Workshop Download Failures

**Issue:** Some Workshop items fail to download

**Solutions:**
- Verify your server has Steam Workshop access enabled
- Check if the Workshop item was removed from Steam
- Try manually subscribing to the Workshop item
- Remove the problematic Workshop ID from the config

### Map Not Loading

**Issue:** Custom maps don't appear in-game

**Solutions:**
- Ensure map mods are in both `Mods=` and `WorkshopItems=`
- Verify the map folder name in `Map=` is correct
- Some maps require specific load order - try loading them first
- Check mod description for special installation instructions

### Export Fails

**Issue:** Export status shows "Failed"

**Solutions:**
- Try exporting again (temporary server issue)
- Verify all mods in the modpack are valid
- Check for mods with missing metadata
- Contact support if the issue persists

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Regular exports">
    Re-export whenever you add or remove mods from your modpack to keep your server in sync.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test before production">
    Test exported configurations on a development server before deploying to production.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Version consistency">
    Keep your server version and export version in sync. Don't mix 41.x exports with 42.x servers.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Document custom changes">
    If you manually edit the exported file, document your changes so you can reapply them after future exports.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share with team">
    Team members can export the same modpack with their own configurations. Coordinate load order for consistency.
  </Step>
