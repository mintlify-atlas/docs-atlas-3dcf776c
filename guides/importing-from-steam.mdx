description: Step-by-step guide to import mods from Steam Workshop collections into your modpack
---

Import your entire Steam Workshop collection into PZ Packs with just a URL. This guide walks you through finding your collection URL, starting the import process, and monitoring the import status.

## Overview

The Steam import feature automatically scrapes all mods from a Steam Workshop collection and adds them to your modpack. The process runs in the background and can take several minutes depending on the collection size.

<Note>
You must be the owner or a member of the modpack to import mods. Public modpacks cannot be modified by non-members.
</Note>

## Finding Your Steam Collection URL

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to your Steam Workshop collection">
    Open Steam and go to the Project Zomboid Workshop, then navigate to your collection or find the collection you want to import.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy the collection URL">
    Copy the full URL from your browser's address bar. It should look like:
    
    ```
    https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=123456789
    ```
    
    The URL must:
    - Be from `steamcommunity.com` domain
    - Contain the `?id=` parameter with your collection ID
    - Point to a collection (not an individual mod)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify it's a collection">
    Make sure the page shows "Collection" at the top, not "Mod". Individual mod pages cannot be imported - only collections.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Starting the Import Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your modpack">
    Navigate to your modpack page in PZ Packs. You'll see an "Import from Steam" button or option in the modpack controls.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enter the Steam Collection URL">
    Click the import button and paste your Steam Workshop collection URL into the text field.
    
    The form validates that:
    - The URL is properly formatted
    - The domain is `steamcommunity.com`
    - The URL contains a valid collection ID
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit the import request">
    Click "Import Modpack" to start the background import process.
    
    You'll receive a confirmation message:
    
    <Note>
    "The modpack is being imported in the background; this may take a few minutes. You will be notified when it is finished."
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What Happens During Import

When you submit an import request, PZ Packs:

1. **Validates the URL** - Checks that the URL points to a valid Steam Workshop collection
2. **Scrapes collection data** - Retrieves all mod Workshop IDs from the collection page
3. **Processes each mod** - For every mod in the collection:
   - Fetches mod metadata from Steam
   - Extracts mod information (name, description, Workshop ID, etc.)
   - Checks for map folders and dependencies
   - Adds the mod to your modpack
4. **Handles dependencies** - Automatically includes required dependencies for multi-part mods
5. **Tracks progress** - Updates the import status as mods are processed

<Tip>
The import process uses a background job queue, so you can close the page and come back later. Your import will continue running.
</Tip>

## Monitoring Import Status

The import status is displayed in real-time on your modpack page:

### Status Types

- **Idle** - No import is currently running
- **Waiting** - Import job is queued and waiting to start
- **Active** - Import is currently processing mods
- **Completed** - All mods have been successfully imported
- **Failed** - The import encountered an error and stopped

### Tracking Progress

While the import is running:

- The status polls automatically every 2 seconds
- Your modpack's mod list refreshes when import completes
- A notification appears when the process finishes

<Warning>
Only one import can run per modpack at a time. If you start a new import, it will replace any existing import job for that modpack.
</Warning>

## Handling Import Errors

### Common Issues

**"Invalid Steam URL"**
- Verify the URL is from `steamcommunity.com`
- Ensure the URL contains the `?id=` parameter
- Check that you copied the complete URL

**"The provided URL is not a Steam Collection"**
- You may have provided a link to an individual mod instead of a collection
- Collections show "Collection" at the top of the Steam Workshop page
- Individual mods must be added manually or as part of a collection

**"You do not have permission to edit this modpack"**
- Only the modpack owner and active members can import mods
- Request the owner to add you as a member first
- Check that the modpack is not archived (inactive)

**"Modpack is not active"**
- The modpack has been archived
- Contact the owner to reactivate it before importing

### Partial Import Failures

If some mods fail to import but others succeed:

- The import will continue processing remaining mods
- Successfully imported mods are added to your modpack
- Error details are logged for failed mods
- You can manually add any failed mods later

<Tip>
After a successful import, review your modpack to ensure all expected mods were added. Some mods may fail to import if they've been removed from Steam Workshop.
</Tip>

## Import Results

When the import completes successfully, you'll see:

- **Added mods count** - Number of mods successfully imported
- **Errors list** - Any mods that failed to import with error messages
- **Updated mod list** - Your modpack automatically refreshes to show new mods

## Best Practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review before importing">
    Check the Steam collection page to verify it contains the mods you want. Large collections may take several minutes to import.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor the import">
    Stay on the page for the first minute to ensure the import starts successfully and doesn't immediately fail.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Verify mod count">
    After import completes, compare the number of added mods to the collection size to ensure all mods were imported.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure export settings">
    After importing, review your [export configuration](/guides/exporting-server-files) to set mod load order and select specific mod variants.
  </Step>
