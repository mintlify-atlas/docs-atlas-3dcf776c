## What is PZ Packs?

**PZ Packs** is a comprehensive SaaS platform designed for Project Zomboid server administrators who need to manage mod collections efficiently. Whether you're running a small private server or managing mods for a large community, PZ Packs streamlines the entire workflow from mod discovery to server configuration export.

Hello, Survivor! Instead of manually tracking Workshop IDs, mod dependencies, and server configuration files, PZ Packs provides a centralized platform where you can:

- Create and organize modpacks with intuitive UI
- Import entire Steam Workshop Collections automatically
- Collaborate with team members on mod curation
- Export ready-to-use server configuration files for both Build 41.x and 42.x
- Share public modpacks with the community

    Sign in securely using your Discord account. No email or password required - just OAuth2 authentication.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Mods">
    Search the mod database, import from Steam Workshop Collections, or manually add mods by Workshop ID. PZ Packs fetches all metadata automatically.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure and Organize">
    Reorder mods for proper load sequence. Configure multi-mod packages by selecting specific Steam Mod IDs. Set up map folders as needed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Export Server Files">
    Select your Project Zomboid build version (41.x or 42.x) and export a ready-to-use server configuration file with all Workshop IDs, mod IDs, and map settings.
  </Step>
</Steps>
