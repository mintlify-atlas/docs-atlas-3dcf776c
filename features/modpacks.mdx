# Modpack Management

Modpacks in PZ Packs allow you to create, organize, and share curated collections of Project Zomboid mods. Whether you're managing mods for a private server or sharing your collection with the community, modpacks provide a centralized way to organize your mod setup.

## Creating a Modpack

Create a new modpack from your dashboard to start organizing your mod collection.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to My Modpacks">
    From your dashboard, click on "My Modpacks" to view all your modpack collections.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create New Modpack">
    Click the "Create Modpack" button to open the creation dialog.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fill in Modpack Details">
    Provide the following information:
    - **Name** (required): A descriptive name for your modpack
    - **Description** (optional): Details about what mods are included and the purpose
    - **Avatar URL** (optional): A square image (recommended 1024x1024px) to represent your modpack
    - **Steam Workshop URL** (optional): Link to your Steam Workshop collection for reference
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save Your Modpack">
    Click "Create" to save your new modpack. You'll be redirected to the modpack details page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  New modpacks are created as **private** by default. You can make them public later through the modpack settings.
</Info>

## Updating Modpack Information

You can update your modpack's metadata at any time if you're the owner.

### Editable Fields

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Basic Information">
    - **Name**: Update the modpack title
    - **Description**: Modify or add details about your collection
    - **Avatar URL**: Change the modpack's visual representation
    - **Steam URL**: Update or add a Steam Workshop collection link
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Visibility Settings">
    **Public/Private Toggle**
    
    - **Private**: Only you and invited members can view and access the modpack
    - **Public**: Anyone can view the modpack and its mod list (appears in public modpack listings)
    
    <Note>
      Changing a modpack to public makes it discoverable by the community. Members you've added will retain their permissions regardless of visibility.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### How to Update

1. Open your modpack details page
2. Click the "Edit Modpack" or settings icon
3. Modify the desired fields
4. Toggle the "Public" switch to change visibility
5. Click "Save" to apply changes

## Modpack Metadata and Ordering

PZ Packs stores advanced configuration metadata for each modpack to ensure proper mod load order and export configuration.

### Mod Load Order

The order in which mods load can affect game stability and functionality. PZ Packs allows you to customize this order:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Reorder Mods" icon="arrows-up-down">
    Drag and drop mods to set the exact load order for your modpack. This order is preserved when exporting server files.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Export Configuration" icon="gear">
    Save custom mod ordering and Steam Mod ID selections per user, allowing different team members to maintain their own export preferences.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Metadata Structure

Each modpack stores the following metadata:

```json
{
  "modsOrder": [
    "mod-uuid-1",
    "mod-uuid-2",
    "mod-uuid-3"
  ],
  "modConfig": {
    "mod-uuid-1": {
      "selectedSteamModIds": ["workshopid1", "workshopid2"]
    }
  }
}
```

<Info>
  **Export configurations** can be saved per user, allowing team members to maintain individual preferences while working on the same modpack.
</Info>

## Importing from Steam Collections

Quickly populate your modpack by importing an existing Steam Workshop collection.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Steam Collection URL">
    Navigate to your Steam Workshop collection and copy the full URL from your browser.
    
    Example: `https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=123456789`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open Import Dialog">
    From your modpack details page, click "Import from Steam" or the import button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Paste Collection URL">
    Enter the Steam Collection URL in the input field.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start Import">
    Click "Import Modpack" to begin the import process. The system will:
    - Fetch all mods from the Steam collection
    - Add them to your modpack
    - Retrieve mod metadata from Steam Workshop
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor Progress">
    The import runs as a background job. You can check the import status from the modpack page.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Importing from Steam can take several minutes depending on the collection size. The import process runs in the background, so you can continue using PZ Packs while it completes.
</Warning>

### Import Status

The import job has three possible states:
- **Pending**: Import is queued or in progress
- **Completed**: All mods successfully imported
- **Failed**: An error occurred during import (check for invalid Steam URLs or private collections)

## Archiving Modpacks

When you no longer need a modpack, you can archive it instead of permanently deleting it. This is a soft delete that preserves data.

### Archive Process

1. Navigate to the modpack you want to archive
2. Click the "Archive" or delete button
3. Confirm the archival in the dialog

<Note>
  **Owner-only action**: Only the modpack owner can archive a modpack. Archived modpacks are marked as inactive (`isActive: false`) but remain in the database.
</Note>

### What Happens When Archived

- The modpack is hidden from your modpack list
- Members lose access to the modpack
- The modpack is removed from public listings (if it was public)
- All mod associations and member data are preserved

<Info>
  Archived modpacks are not permanently deleted. Contact support if you need to restore an archived modpack.
</Info>

## Modpack Verification

Verified modpacks receive a special badge and appear more prominently in public listings.

<Card title="Verified Badge" icon="badge-check">
  Modpacks can be verified by administrators to indicate:
  - High-quality, well-maintained collections
  - Official or community-endorsed modpacks
  - Thoroughly tested mod combinations
</Card>

<Note>
  Verification is managed by PZ Packs administrators. If you believe your modpack should be verified, contact the support team.
</Note>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Naming Conventions">
    - Use descriptive names that indicate the modpack's purpose (e.g., "Hardcore Survival", "Building & Furniture Expansion")
    - Keep names concise but informative
    - Avoid special characters that might cause issues with file systems
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Description Guidelines">
    - List the main mod categories or features
    - Mention compatibility (Build 41 vs 42)
    - Note any special configuration requirements
    - Include server settings recommendations if applicable
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Avatar Images">
    - Use square images (1:1 aspect ratio)
    - Recommended resolution: 1024x1024px
    - Host images on reliable CDNs or image hosting services
    - Ensure the URL is publicly accessible
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Mod Organization">
    - Group related mods together
    - Place core/framework mods at the top of the load order
    - Test the load order before sharing with team members
    - Document any known conflicts in the description
  </Accordion>
