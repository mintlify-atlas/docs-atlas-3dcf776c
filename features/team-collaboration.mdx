# Team Collaboration

PZ Packs supports collaborative modpack management through a flexible team member system. Add team members to your modpacks, assign granular permissions, and work together to maintain your mod collections.

## Overview

Collaboration features allow multiple users to work on the same modpack with different levels of access control.

## Adding Team Members

Invite users to collaborate on your modpack.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Modpack">
    Navigate to the modpack details page for the modpack you want to share.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Access Members Section">
    Click on "Members" or the team icon to view the members list.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Add Member">
    Click the "Add Member" button to open the invitation dialog.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Email Address">
    Type the email address of the user you want to add.
    
    <Info>
      The user must already have a PZ Packs account with this email address.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign Permissions">
    Select which permissions to grant the new member (see Permission System below).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Send Invitation">
    Click "Add Member" to add them to the modpack.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Requirements

<Note>
  Only the **modpack owner** can add members. The `manager-members` permission is required, which is exclusive to owners.
</Note>

- The invitee must have an active PZ Packs account
- The email must exactly match their account email
- You cannot add the same user twice to a modpack

## Removing Team Members

Remove members who no longer need access to the modpack.

<Steps>
  <Step title="View Members List">
    Navigate to the members section of your modpack.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Member to Remove">
    Find the member you want to remove from the list.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Remove">
    Click the remove button next to their name.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm Removal">
    Confirm the removal in the dialog box.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Removing a member immediately revokes their access to the modpack. They will no longer be able to view or modify it unless they are re-added.
</Warning>

### Removal Notes

- Members are soft-deleted (marked as `isActive: false`)
- Member records are preserved in the database for audit purposes
- You cannot remove yourself if you're the owner
- Only owners can remove members

## Permission System

PZ Packs uses a granular permission system to control what team members can do.

### Available Permissions

Permissions are stored as an array of action strings. Here are the permissions available in PZ Packs:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Read" icon="eye">
    **Permission**: `read`
    
    **Allows**:
    - View the modpack details
    - See the modpack in "My Modpacks" list
    - Access modpack information

    </Info>
  </Accordion>

    </Note>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Permission Assignment

When adding a member, you can select which permissions they receive:

```typescript
// Example permission array for a member
permission: [
  "read",
  "add-mod",
  "remove-mod",
  "export"
]
```

### Default Permission Sets

While PZ Packs allows custom permission combinations, here are some common permission sets:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Viewer">
    **Permissions**: `["read"]`
    
    Can only view the modpack and its mods. Cannot make changes.
    
    **Use case**: Sharing modpack information without allowing modifications.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Contributor">
    **Permissions**: `["read", "add-mod", "remove-mod"]`
    
    Can view and manage mods but cannot change modpack settings.
    
    **Use case**: Team members who curate the mod list.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Editor">
    **Permissions**: `["read", "update", "add-mod", "remove-mod", "export"]`
    
    Can manage mods, update modpack details, and export configurations.
    
    **Use case**: Trusted collaborators who maintain the modpack.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Full Access">
    **Permissions**: `["read", "update", "add-mod", "remove-mod", "import", "export", "archive"]`
    
    Can do everything except manage members.
    
    **Use case**: Co-maintainers who need nearly full control.
    
    <Note>
      Even with all permissions, members cannot add or remove other members. That's owner-only.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Member Roles

While PZ Packs doesn't have formal "roles," there are two functional levels:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Owner" icon="crown">
    - One owner per modpack
    - Cannot be changed or transferred
    - Has all permissions automatically
    - Can manage members
    - Can archive the modpack
    
    The owner is the user who created the modpack.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Member" icon="user">
    - Multiple members allowed
    - Permissions assigned individually
    - Cannot manage other members
    - Can be removed by owner
    - Access controlled by permission array
    
    Members are users added by the owner.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Viewing Members

See who has access to your modpack and what they can do.

### Member List Display

The members section shows:

- **Member avatar**: Profile picture (if set)
- **Name**: Display name or email
- **Permissions**: What actions they can perform
- **Added date**: When they were added to the modpack
- **Status**: Active or inactive

### Member Avatars

Members are displayed with avatar buttons that show:
- Profile picture thumbnail
- Tooltip with full name and email
- Visual indication of member count

<Info>
  If there are more members than can be displayed, a "Show Remaining" option appears to view the full list.
</Info>

## Access Control Flow

How permissions are checked when members perform actions:

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Requests Action">
    A member attempts to perform an action (e.g., add a mod).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Authentication Check">
    The system verifies the user is logged in and has an active session.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Ownership Check">
    If the user is the modpack owner, they automatically have all permissions. Process ends here.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Membership Check">
    The system checks if the user is a member of the modpack and if their membership is active (`isActive: true`).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Permission Check">
    The system verifies the required permission is in the member's permission array.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Action Allowed or Denied">
    - If all checks pass: Action is allowed
    - If any check fails: Action is denied with appropriate error message
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Permission Enforcement

Permissions are enforced at multiple levels:

1. **API Routes**: Server-side permission checks before executing actions
2. **UI Components**: Buttons and features are hidden if user lacks permission
3. **Database Queries**: User context filters data access

<Warning>
  UI hiding is not a security measure - permissions are always enforced server-side. The UI simply provides a better user experience by hiding unavailable options.
</Warning>

## Sharing Modpacks

While PZ Packs doesn't have a "share link" feature, there are several ways to share modpacks:

### Public Modpacks

<Steps>
  <Step title="Make Modpack Public">
    Edit your modpack and toggle the "Public" switch to on.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share the URL">
    Copy your browser's URL from the modpack page and share it.
    
    Example: `https://pzpacks.com/modpacks/abc-123`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Others Can View">
    Anyone with the link can view the modpack, its mods, and export server files (if authenticated).
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Private Modpacks with Members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Keep Modpack Private">
    Do not enable the "Public" setting.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add Members">
    Add specific users as members with appropriate permissions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Members Get Access">
    Members can view and interact with the modpack based on their permissions.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  Public modpacks appear in the public modpack listings and can be discovered by anyone. Private modpacks only appear to the owner and members.
</Info>

## Limitations

<Note>
  Current limitations of the team collaboration system:
  
  - No role templates or presets (permissions are manually assigned)
  - Cannot transfer ownership of a modpack
  - No notification system for modpack changes
  - Member activity is not tracked in the UI
  - No "pending invitation" state (users must have accounts first)
</Note>
