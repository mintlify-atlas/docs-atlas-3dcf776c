## Adding Mods to Modpacks

Add mods to your modpack using Workshop IDs or Steam URLs.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Your Modpack">
    Navigate to the modpack details page where you want to add mods.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click Add Mod">
    Click the "Add Mod" button to open the add mod dialog.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enter Mod Information">
    Provide either:
    - **Workshop ID**: The numeric ID from the Steam Workshop URL
    - **Steam URL**: The full Steam Workshop URL for the mod
    
    Examples:
    - Workshop ID: `2876012699`
    - Steam URL: `https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2876012699`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add the Mod">
    Click "Add Mod" to add it to your modpack. The system will:
    - Check if the mod exists in the PZ Packs database
    - Fetch mod details from Steam if it's a new mod
    - Add the mod to your modpack's mod list
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  You need the **add-mod** permission to add mods to a modpack. Owners have this permission by default. See [Team Collaboration](/features/team-collaboration) for permission details.
</Warning>

### Automatic Mod Fetching

When you add a mod that doesn't exist in the PZ Packs database:

1. The system fetches mod information from Steam Workshop API
2. Mod metadata is stored in the database for future use
3. The mod becomes available in the global mod browser
4. The mod is added to your modpack

## Removing Mods from Modpacks

Remove mods you no longer need from your modpack.

1. Navigate to your modpack's mod list
2. Find the mod you want to remove
3. Click the remove/delete button on the mod card
4. Confirm the removal in the dialog

<Note>
  Removing a mod from a modpack does **not** delete the mod from the PZ Packs database. It only removes the association between the mod and your modpack.
</Note>

### Permissions Required

- **Owner**: Can remove any mod
- **Members with remove-mod permission**: Can remove mods from the modpack

See [Team Collaboration](/features/team-collaboration) for more on permissions.

## Mod Configuration

Some mods have multiple Steam Mod IDs. PZ Packs allows you to select which IDs to include in exports.

### Selecting Steam Mod IDs

When configuring your export settings:

1. Open the "Reorder & Configure Export" view
2. For mods with multiple Steam Mod IDs, you'll see checkboxes for each ID
3. Select/deselect IDs to include in your server configuration export
4. Save your configuration

<Info>
  By default, all Steam Mod IDs for a mod are selected. Deselecting all IDs for a mod will exclude it from the export entirely.
</Info>
